	UserAgentMatcher = require './UserAgentMatcher'

This class strips the user agent string from the request headers and parses it using the `UserAgentMatcher` class.

	class Parser

The constructor takes the request as parameter as given by Express. It then stores the user agent string. The rest of the request is discarded.

		constructor: (req) ->
			@agent = req.headers['user-agent']

The `getDevice` function tries to determine which type of device has sent the request.

		getDevice: ->

If the user agent string is empty, it will fallback to `desktop`.

			unless @agent
				return 'desktop'

			matcher = new UserAgentMatcher @agent
			return 'desktop' if matcher.matchDesktop()
			return 'tv' if matcher.matchTV()
			return 'tablet' if matcher.matchTablet()
			return 'bot' if matcher.matchBot()

If the user agent string was not recognized it will be assumed to be a phone (this is basically laziness and might change in future versions!).

			return 'phone'
